# Mastermind Game (Java Implementation)

This is a console-based implementation of the classic code-breaking game, Mastermind, built with Java.

## About The Project

The goal of this project was to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to build a fully functional and logical game. The program generates a secret code of colors, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the code. After each guess, the program provides feedback on the number of correct colors in the correct and incorrect positions.

## Features

* Random secret code generation for each new game.
* User input handling and validation.
* Clear feedback system for player guesses.
* A limited number of attempts to increase the challenge.

## Technologies Used

* **Java**
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository or download the `.java` files.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3.  Compile the source code:
    ```sh
    javac MastermindGame.java
    ```
4.  Run the game:
    ```sh
    java MastermindGame
    ```
